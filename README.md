# Best-Cricketer-Debate
The Best-Cricketer-Debate is a team-based assignment where we dive into a friendly yet insightful discussion comparing two cricketing legends, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. Our goal is to explore their playing styles, leadership qualities, records, and impact on the game. Through research, analysis, and respectful debate, we aim to present compelling arguments to determine who stands out as the better cricketer. This assignment allows us to collaborate, share perspectives, and appreciate the unique contributions both players have made to Indian cricket.
